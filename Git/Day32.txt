#Rebase

Rebase is nothing but adjusting the history of feature branch without a merge commit from origin branch.

let me explain now so that i can understand it better when i am revising.

let's consider two branches - main and feature

main has commits m1, m2 and feature is created from main from m2 commit.

feature has commits m1 and m2 now in its history and HEAD is located at m2 commit. 

now main has a new commit m3 but feature does not have that new update in its history.

so now if we use rebase on feature branch it will be like the feature branch is created from m3 commit.

and the new commit id is generated to reflect that.

git rebase origin/master --> to be executed when on feature branch.
