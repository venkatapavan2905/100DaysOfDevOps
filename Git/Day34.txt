#Git hooks.

Hooks are used to automate or trigger a task after or before a certain event like commit, push etc.,

cd hooks/

example:

1. remove .sample for the hook file to take effect.

2. vi post-update

#!/bin/bash
git --git-dir=/opt/beta.git tag release-$(date +%F)

3. This will attach a release tag for every push to the master.
